## 🎓 Summer Academy Package

The downloaded package from `C:\Users\zach\Downloads\Goodbody_Summer_Academy_COMPLETE_v2\final_package` is copied into `public/academy/package` and served by the current app under `/academy/package/...`.

Key app links:
- `/academy/package/0_START_HERE/START_HERE.md`
- `/academy/package/7_PRINTABLES/fridge_menus.pdf`
- `/academy/package/9_TRACKING_SHEETS/summer_tracker.xlsx`
- `/academy/package/6_PPTX_KICKOFF/summer_kickoff_deck.pptx`
- `/academy/academy-data.json`

The backend default reward catalog now includes Summer Academy actions such as lesson completion, video watched, writing page, sports goals, project milestones, and perfect week bonus. Existing family catalogs receive these default actions at catalog-read time without overwriting custom entries.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- Firebase account

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/WeCr8/goodbodybucks.git
cd goodbodybucks
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Firebase

#### Get Service Account Key
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project (or create one)
3. **Project Settings** → **Service Accounts** → **Generate New Private Key**
4. Save as `serviceAccountKey.json` in the project root

#### Enable Firebase Services
1. **Authentication** → Enable **Email/Password**
2. **Firestore Database** → **Create Database** (Production mode)

#### Update Frontend Config
Edit `index.html` around line 130-135 with your Firebase web app credentials:
```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT.firebasestorage.app",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
};
```

### 4. Start the Backend
```bash
python app.py
```
Or use the batch file:
```bash
run_flask.bat
```

### 5. Open the App
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

## 📋 Testing Workflow

### 1. Create a Family

- Click "Create Family"
- **Copy the Family ID** (you'll need this!)

### 2. Create Admin Account
**Option A**: Via Firebase Console
- Go to Firebase Console → Authentication → Add User
- Create user with email/password

**Option B**: Auto-bootstrap (first user)
- Enter Family ID
- Enter your email and password (6+ characters)
- Click "Login Admin"
- First user auto-becomes admin

### 3. Login as Admin
- Enter Family ID
- Enter admin email/password
- Click "Login Admin"

### 4. Add a Kid Account

  - Click "Add Member"

### 5. Login as Kid
- Enter Family ID
- Enter kid name (e.g., "Miles")
- Enter PIN (e.g., "1234")

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Frontend
- **Single-page application** (`index.html`)
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - No frameworks
- **Firebase JS SDK** - Authentication and client-side logic
- **Responsive CSS** - Dark theme, card-based UI

### Backend
- **Python Flask** - RESTful API
- **Firebase Admin SDK** - Server-side Firebase operations
- **Firestore** - NoSQL database
- **Transaction support** - Atomic money/minute updates

### Database Structure
```
families/{familyId}/
  ├── members/{uid}        # User profiles (admin/kid)
  ├── wallets/{uid}        # GB$ balance, minutes, locked status
  ├── sessions/{uid}       # Active timer sessions
  ├── purchases/{docId}    # Purchase history
  └── ledger/{docId}       # Hash-chained audit log
```

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Backend**: Python 3.12, Flask
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth
- **Hosting**: Firebase Hosting
- **Images**: Static files served via Flask

## 📦 Deployment

### Firebase Hosting (Frontend)
```bash
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

### Cloud Run (Backend) - Optional
```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT/gbucks-api .

# Push to Container Registry
docker push gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT/gbucks-api

# Deploy to Cloud Run
gcloud run deploy gbucks-api \
  --image gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT/gbucks-api \
  --region us-west1 \
  --platform managed
```

## 🔒 Security

### Protected Files (Not in Git)
- `serviceAccountKey.json` - Firebase admin credentials
- `goodbodybucks-firebase-adminsdk-*.json` - Service account keys
- `__pycache__/` - Python bytecode cache

### Security Best Practices
- ✅ Service account keys excluded via `.gitignore`
- ✅ Firebase Auth for user authentication
- ✅ ID token validation on all API requests
- ✅ Role-based access control (admin vs kid)
- ✅ Family-level data isolation
- ✅ Transaction-based atomic updates
